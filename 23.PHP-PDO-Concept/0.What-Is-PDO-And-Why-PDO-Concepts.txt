What is PDO?
=============
a) PDO Stands for PHP Data Object.
b) It is a data abstraction layer which unifies the communication(interfaces) between 
    the databases and the application.
c) It has DNS(Data Source Name) which is a string that has associated data 
    structure to describe a connection to a data source.

d) It allows to work with any database that has a PDO driver available. PDO relies on 
    database-specific drivers, e.g., PDO_MYSQL for MySQL, PDO_PGSQL for 
    PostgreSQL, PDO_OCI for Oracle database, etc., to function properly.
